## Instructions and objective
Join numbers to get to the 2048 tile! Use arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles having the same number touch, they join into one.

For example, assume we have the board on the left-hand side. By clicking on the left arrow keyboard, all rows will slide left and we will obtain the board on the right-hand side.
