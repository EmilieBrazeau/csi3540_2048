## Instructions and objective
Join numbers to get to the 2048 tile! Use arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles having the same number touch, they join into one.

For example, assume we have the board on the left-hand side. By clicking on the left arrow keyboard, all rows will slide left and we will obtain the board on the right-hand side. We can observe that the 2s from the bottom rows merged with their left-neighbour to become a 4.
</br>
</br>
Also, everytime the board changes from a slide, a new tile is added: a "2" is added 90% and a "4" is added 10% of the time. In this specific case, a "4" was added and it's the one from the top row.

## Documentation
I [documented](/assets/design_system/) some components of the implementation and I also included a [design system](/docs/design_system.md).
