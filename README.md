## Instructions and objective
Join numbers to get to the 2048 tile! Use arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles having the same number touch, they join into one.
</br>
</br>
The game is over when the board is full and no more merges can be completed, no matter what direction of the arrow-key.
</br>
</br>
For example, assume we have the board on the left-hand side. By clicking on the left arrow keyboard, all rows will slide left and we will obtain the board on the right-hand side. We can observe that the 2s from the bottom rows merged with their left-neighbour to become 4s. Since two pairs of 2s merged, a total of 8 was added to the score.
</br>
</br>
Also, everytime the board changes from a slide, a new tile is added: a "2" is added 90% of the time and a "4" is added 10% of the time. In this specific case, a "4" was added and it's the one from the top row.
